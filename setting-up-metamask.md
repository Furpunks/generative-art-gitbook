# Setting up Metamask

In order to mint our NFTs we will be using the Remix IDE which will require us to use Metamask.

If you don't have Metamask already set up you will need to install it in Chrome. Visit metamask.io for instructions:

Once you have Metamask installed we need to connect it to the testnet. The testnet allows us to interact with a fully functioning blockchain without using real crypto.

To connect to the testnet we need to first click on the Metamask icon in Chrome.

Now click on Ethereum Mainnet, you will then see Show/hide test networks and a screen similar to the one below. If you have already been using Metamask as most of you probably have, you may see additional networks in your list.

Click on Show/hide test networks. The following settings will be displayed. We want to turn On the Show test networks setting.

Once the test networks have been enabled close this page and click on Etherum Mainnet again. You will now see the test networks which we can choose from. We want to use the Rinkeby Test Network so click on that.

You will now notice that Ethereum Mainnet has changed to Rinkeby Test Network.

### Test Funds

Now that we have Metamask connected to the test network we need to supply our wallet with some test Ethereum. To do this we can use what is called a faucet.&#x20;

For this guide we will use the rinkeby faucet at: [https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby). Feel free to use any other faucet. I tend to find the one provided by Chainlink to be pretty reliable.

To use the faucet we need to copy our Eth address. You can easily do this by opening Metamask and clicking on Account 1 (or whatever you have named your account).

Once we have our address copied head over to the faucet and paste in your address and be sure that 0.1 test ETH is selected then click Send request.

Within a few seconds you should now have test each in your wallet. If you click on Metamask you will be able to see your updated balance.

### Summary

With Metamask installed and our wallet funded we can now move on to minting our NFTs on the testnet.
