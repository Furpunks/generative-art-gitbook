# Asset Layers

Assets are probably one of, if not _the_, most important part of creating NFTs. Without good assets your final image will not look very good. I'm pretty terrible at artistic endeavours so don't judge my Krypto Kitty NFTs too harshly!

The Furpunks repo has four pre loaded layer assets for you to play with. You can view them under the 'layers' folder in Explorer. You will see Background, Body Colour, Colar and Eyes like the following screenshot.

To view one of the assets click on the folder and classification next to the corresponding one. Below you will see I have selected Brown#50.png from the Body Colour layer.

You will need to create many more layers in order to generate a large number of unique NFTS.
