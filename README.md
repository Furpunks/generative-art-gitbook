# Furpunks Intro

Furpunks is what happens when you cross a CryptoPunk with a Cat!



If you don't know already, CryptoPunks were created by Larva Labs and launched in 2017 as pixel art NFT.

Since their inception, CryptoPunks have been the inspiration behind countless other NFT projects and Furpunks is no different.



My aim with this project was to learn how to create my own set of auto generated NFTs and document the process so that others could easily follow along and create theirs.&#x20;



Furpunks are based on the mascot for the memecoin (meowmcoin) Krypto Kitty. You can learn more about Krypto Kitty and their project on their official website: [https://kryptokitty.cc/](https://kryptokitty.cc)

Krypto Kitty also have a super friendly community of crypto and cat lovers in their Telegram group: [https://t.me/KryptoKittyTalk](https://t.me/KryptoKittyTalk)



Furpunks and Krypto Kitty are not affliated in anyway other than our love for $KTY and of course cats!
