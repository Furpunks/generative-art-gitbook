Now that we have our NFTs generated we need a place to store them so that people can access and view them.

There are few different ways you can go about serving your NFTs to people with Shared Hosting and IPFS being the two most popular options. Other options such as Dropbox or One Drive also exist but for the purposes of this guide we will focus on IPFS as that is the most decentralised way to store your NFTs forever online.&#x20;

If you don't know what IPFS is, it stands for InterPlanetary File System and essentially decentralised storage kind of like having a permanent hard drive in the cloud that anyone can access. That is of course an over simplification so if you fancy reading up on IPFS, which I recommend, you can do so here:

### Pros and Cons of Different Storage Solutions

Here are a few pros and cons of the different options.

#### **Shared Hosting**

**PROS**

* Easy to set up and configure
* Can modify JSON and PNG files any time

**CONS**

* Susceptible to outages due to hosting provider, VPS downtime, missed payment, etc
* Lack of trustworthiness that files will not be altered.

#### IPFS

**PROS**

* Easy to set up and configure
* Semi permanent storage so NFTs always available as long as you pay monthly fees
* Trustworthy source

**CONS**

* Permanent - if you make a mistake in the JSON or NFT, it is very nearly impossible to fix.



**Arweave**

**PROS**

* Easy to set up and configure
* Truly permanent storage solution for NFTs
* No service outages
* Trustworthy source

**CONS**

* Similar to IPFS, if you make a mistake with your JSON or PNG, it is impossible to change it.
