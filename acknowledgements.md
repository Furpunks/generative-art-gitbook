This guide uses the opensource code and video tutorials created by Hashlips as its foundation.

The Furpunks github repository was cloned from Hashlips generative-art-opensource.git v3 and modified to fit the requirements of Furpunks. A new repository for Furpunks was then created for planned and future changes and developments specific to the Furpunks project.

Hashlips has created an excellent video tutorial that walks you throug the process of using the Hashlips github code to create a set of NFTs. If you haven't watch it already I recomend doing so, however, watching the video is not a requirement to follow this guide.

This guide builds upon the content of the video and aims to flesh out additional areas.
