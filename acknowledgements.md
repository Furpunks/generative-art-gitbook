This guide uses the opensource code and video tutorials created by Hashlips as its foundation.

The Furpunks github repository was forked from Hashlips / hashlip art engine and modified to for planned and future changes and developments specific to the Furpunks project.

Hashlips also created an excellent video tutorial that walks you through the process of using the Hashlips github code to create a set of NFTs. If you haven't watched it already I recommend doing so, however, watching the video is not a requirement to follow this guide.

This guide builds upon the content of the video and aims to flesh out additional areas.
