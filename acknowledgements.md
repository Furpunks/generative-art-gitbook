This guide uses the opensource code and excellent video tutorials created by Hashlips as its foundation.

The Furpunks github repository was cloned from Hashlips generative-art-opensource.git v3 and modified. A new repository for Furpunks was created for planned and future changes and developments specific to Furpunks.

Hashlips has created an excellent video tutorial that walks you throug the process of using his github code to create a set of NFTs. If you haven't watch it already I recomend doing so and if you enjoyed it be sure to give him a like and subscribe. Watching the video is not a requirement to follow this guide.

This guide builds upon the content of the video and aims to flesh additional areas out.
