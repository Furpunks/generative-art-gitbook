# NFT Marketplace

This section will cover how to link, or add, your NFTs to an NFT marketplace. This guide will cover using OpenSea but other marketplaces will be added in the future.

As mentioned previously, OpenSea is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and as such it is currently susceptible to high gas fees. For the purposes of this guide we will be using OpenSea on testnet which should give you a good idea of how adding NFTs to marketplaces work.&#x20;
