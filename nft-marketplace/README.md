# NFT Marketplace

This section will cover how to link, or add, your NFTs to an NFT marketplace. This guide will cover using OpenSea and Rarible but other marketplaces will be added in the future.

OpenSea is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and supports both Ethereum and Polygon. Ethereum is currently susceptible to very high gas fees whereas using Polygon is essentially gas fee free.

So consideration should be given to which blockchain to use.

For the purposes of this guide we will be using OpenSea and Rarible on testnet which should give you a good idea of how adding NFTs to marketplaces work.

Before we get started make sure you have your smart contract address to hand. If you don't, open Remix and copy it by clicking the copy icon next to your deployed contract. See yellow circle in the following screenshot.
