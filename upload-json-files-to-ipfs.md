# Upload JSON Files to IPFS

We now need to upload our newly updated JSON files to IPFS. These steps will be the same as those used to upload our NFT images.

To get started, head back over to Pinata and click upload Folder.

We want to browse to where the json files are. They will be in the same parent folder as our NFT images. Find your folder and click upload.

You will be prompted to confirm you want to upload all the contents of the folder. Click upload if you are sure.

We now need to give our folder a name just like we did for the images. I've called this one Furpunks\_NFT_\__Test\_Json.

Once your JSON files have been uploaded you should see a new folder appear on your Files page like so:

That's it! We've uploaded all the files we need to IPFS. Our NFTs are on their way to being fully decentralised and will now live on IPFS forever.

Lastly, we need to copy our CID for the Json folder. You can do that by clicking the copy icon next to the CID for your new folder or as in the screenshot above Furpunks\_NFT\_Test\_Json. Hang on to it as we will need it when in comes time to mint our NFTs.

### Summary

With our files safely stored online we now need to bring all our work together and mint our NFT smart contract.
